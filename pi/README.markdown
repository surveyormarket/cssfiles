# Degrees to PI dial drawn in canvas

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/JFarrow/pen/EqyKpw](https://codepen.io/JFarrow/pen/EqyKpw).

I saw this dial illustrated in the 'Getting Started with Processing' book (http://goo.gl/7oHrt) on page 21. I thought it would make a nice little project to recreate it using JavaScript Canvas. I have set an onResize event listener so that the canvas is redrawn to fit the browser window at all times, causing the illustration to remain crisp like a vector image.
