<label for="header1">Why is a Member Number Important?</label>
<div><p>&nbsp;Your Land Surveyors United account is now associated with a Member #. Your Member # will now become your Raffle # for an entire year, when you elevate the status of your account as a sustaining member. Your member number is based on the order in which you joined us. It's good to know your Member # for many reasons but most importantly because it will sting if we draw your # during the monthly raffle drawing and you didn't know you won. Remember it, because you will have at least 12 chances to win the monthly Raffle, via live stream on the last day of every month, as owner of it. Remember it because we need you to tell us your Member # at check out when you subscribe to Basic Membership or higher on Land Surveyors United Community. Remember it because it might be the Golden Ticket in one of those 12 monthly raffle drawings every year. Remember it because you will need your Member Raffle Number to claim the monthly Raffle Prize, if your number is drawn. Remember it because it now literally saves you money anytime you mention your Member number while doing business with any of our community Smarketplace Vendors. Only those Sustaining Members who have upgraded to Basic Membership or higher are eligable to win the monthly Raffle Prize.<br />

<label for="header2">How do I find my Member Number?</label>
<div><p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>A few members wrote in because they were unable to find their member number.</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">I managed to not only fix this, i went ahead and updated all of the new members in the community so now everyone in the network up to yesterday 5PM EST should now be in the system and you can find your <a href="https://landsurveyorsunited.com/member-number" target="_blank" rel="noopener">member number</a> more easily.&nbsp; &nbsp;I streamlined the process a bit on the <a href="https://landsurveyorsunited.com/memberships" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Memberships/Raffle page</a>.&nbsp; When you find your Member Number, please make a note of it as it will never change from this point forward.&nbsp; You will want to have an easy way to reference your Member Number on the last day of every month as it will be your chance at winning the entire Raffle Prize for the Month.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Note:</strong>&nbsp; From this point forward, new member numbers will be added to the system on the 15th and last day of the month.&nbsp; &nbsp;So if you joined the community after the 1st or 15th, your member number will be retrievable on the 16th or on the <a href="https://landsurveyorsunited.com/events/Monthly+Raffle" target="_blank" rel="noopener">day before any scheduled raffle drawing</a>.</span></p> </div>

<label for="header4">When I upgrade my membership, does that qualify me only for the month that I upgrade?</label>
<div> <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>When I upgrade my membership, does that qualify me <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>only</em></span> for the month that I upgrade?</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 16px;">No.&nbsp; <em><strong>You get <span style="text-decoration: underline;">at least</span> 12 chances to win</strong></em>... All levels of membership apply to your member number for the entire year beginning when you upgrade your account.&nbsp; In other words, if you upgrade as a Basic Member, you get 1 Raffle Number Per Month for 12 months.&nbsp; So you have 12 tickets with different prizes available every month.&nbsp; For example, for $50/yr you might win a Total Station or a GPS package or a software suite.&nbsp; The most important thing is what you also get with your membership such as access to private sections of the community, access to all of the deals and rewards of the Smarketplace, in addition to the upcoming Survey Education Courses and App coming in early February.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>Ok, So how many chances to win the raffle do I actually get when I upgrade?</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 16px;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">For Basic Membership</span> - <strong>12 Tickets</strong> 1 per month.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 16px;">Best suited for individual member</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 16px;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">For Futurist Membership</span> - <strong>24 Tickets</strong>&nbsp; 2 per month</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 16px;">Best for those who can sponsor a member who cannot afford membership</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 16px;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">For Masterclass</span> - <strong>60 Tickets</strong>&nbsp; 5 per month</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 16px;">Best for Member + 4 sponsored members with extra perks for purchaser</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 16px;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">For Big Boss</span> - <strong>240 Tickets</strong>&nbsp; 20 per month</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 16px;">Best for company owner and sponsorship of employees with major business perks..</span></p></div>

<div><p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>If I purchase a Futurist Membership or higher, do I have to give my extra raffle tickets to those I sponsor?</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 16px;">By sponsoring another surveyor who cannot afford membership, you have the choice of either giving your sponsored member the raffle ticket or keep it for yourself.&nbsp; By sponsoring another member you double&nbsp; or triple increase your chances of winning but it is up to you as to whether or not to keep the extra raffle ticket or give it to them.&nbsp; &nbsp;Once you are matched with a member to sponsor you will be given a short bio about who you sponsored with information such as how long they have been surveying, where they are located and most importantly, their Member Number, which you will essentially become owner for purposes of the raffle.</span></p>

<label for="header6">Can I sponsor a fellow surveyor, but keep thier raffle ticket?</label>
<div> Absolutely!  Helping a fellowSurveyor who cannot afford membership pushes everyone forward. Reward yourself for your gesture, if you like.  For example,You'll get 2 raffle tickets per month as a Futurist or higher and it is your choice to either keep their raffle ticket or give it to the member you sponsor. As a Futurist, you essentially become the owner/steward of the Member/Raffle number associated with the member you sponsor. You will also be given a choice between 3 members to sponsor based on their relationship and experience in land surveying. As a sponsor you will be providing access to all of the educational tools, resources and knowledgebase for a member who otherwise would only have restricted access.</div>

<div><p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>I am a Student or Retired Surveyor who cannot afford Membership</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">IMPORTANT:&nbsp; If you are not making money as a land surveyor, we have you covered, but you need to <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf0T-VMSn62dV_SWoH7Spbbl_jQNrhXZ6AR6U7HU_gQ9CyJLw/viewform?embedded=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">let us know</a>.&nbsp; &nbsp;If you do not let us know, we will not be able to remove the restricted access from your account and therefore you will only be seeing 20% of what Land Surveyors United Community has to offer you.&nbsp; There is a place <a href="https://landsurveyorsunited.com/memberships" target="_blank" rel="noopener">inside the memberships page</a> for you to explicitly <span style="text-decoration: underline;">tell us that you are not currently able to afford membership</span>.&nbsp; &nbsp;By filling out <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf0T-VMSn62dV_SWoH7Spbbl_jQNrhXZ6AR6U7HU_gQ9CyJLw/viewform?embedded=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this form</a>, we will be able to match you with an available sponsor.&nbsp; &nbsp;Once the parties are in communication, it is between you to decide how raffle tickets will be distributed. In other words, your sponsor may choose to keep your raffle number which means they essentially own your Member Number for the year and will have 12 chances to win with your number.&nbsp; Nevertheless, you will be afforded all of the access and permissions to access restricted areas and resources that a Basic Member will have across the community and all member apps.</span></p> </div>

<label for="header10">Where do the Raffle Prizes come from?</label>
<div><p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>Where do the Raffle Prizes come from?</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Every month of 2021 and beyond, our community is sponsored by a different <a href="http://landsurveyorsunited.com/marketplace">Marketplace Vendor</a> who we believe you should reach out to and get to know.&nbsp; The raffle prizes will all be a showcase of the best of the best offered by these vendors, who have all been hand chosen based on customer service quality, willingness to support what they sell and overall feedback across the community.&nbsp; &nbsp;Those vendors recieve an entire month of our community support and love in exchange for their sponsorship of our unity for the month.&nbsp; For example, Safety Apparel is the sponsor of January as it is Safety Month and the high quality safety gear they provide our members saves lives every single day.&nbsp; &nbsp;We celebrate them. We follow them.&nbsp; We share what they are doing in the world to make land surveying better and so should you.&nbsp; At the end of the month, a Major Mega Survey Party Pack of vests, gloves and accessories will be awarded to the winning Raffle Member Number.&nbsp; &nbsp;It is true that we shall celebrate Safety Apparel every month of the year, but their month to shine in the community is the entire month of January.&nbsp; In February, Survipod becomes our Sponsor of the month and we will showcase their innovations and will raffle a prize at the end of the month.&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>NOTE:</strong>&nbsp; Our 2021 months are starting to fill up quickly and there are presently only 6 months left to claim, so if you would like to be showcased for a month in 2021, <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeJ8Suf7exO4JYEppSWqpI0N_3lcqnXu0bjeb97-Xxm1eawcQ/viewform?embedded=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">please get in touch asap</a> so you do not miss the opportunity to get your products/services in front of thousands of surveyors around the planet who want to test them out, use them, love them, hate them but most importantly, get to know your company/brand better..&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p> </div>

<div><p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>What if I want to purchase the same products showcased in the raffle from the Sponsor of the Month?</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">You do not need to win the raffle for the month to own the products provided by our sponsors.&nbsp; In fact, if you contact the sponsor and<strong><em> let them know that you are a Land Surveyors United member</em></strong>, they have all agreed to provide a special member discount for you when purchasing the products they offer.</span></p> </div>

<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">If you have a profile on Land Surveyors United and you are not a land surveyor, you must be a special case.&nbsp; However, I must inform you that our member raffle is for Land Surveyors only.&nbsp; &nbsp;In other words, if your member number is drawn and you are a) not a land surveyor and/or b) you have not upgraded your membership, we will draw another number.&nbsp; Only those numbers which coorespond to a member number matching an upgraded membership are eligable to win the raffle prize.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Note:</strong> All profiles <em>which are not</em> Land Surveyors, Students, Retired Surveyors, Geoeducators, Seeking Employment, Recruiters or Tech specialists have restricted access and will only be able to see certain sections of the community, apps and resources.&nbsp; &nbsp;Many sections of the site will only be visible and usable once a member profile has been upgraded.</span></p>

<label for="header13">I can no longer access my account because I switched companies</label>
<div>How Long Has it Been Since you Switched Companies?
Our community will soon turn 15 years old and a question that I am getting more and more is "I no longer work at the company that I worked at when I signed up, so I no longer have that email - what do I do?"    This is simple, if you remember the password.   Although you can no longer access your old email, all you need to do is sign in to the community using it and the password.  Once you are inside your account, go into your profile settings and designate a new email.  You'll just need to confirm that email and you are all set.   If you cannot remember your password and cannot reset it, create a new profile and we will merge your accounts for you.   Don't miss out on all of the new exciting things we are doing like monthly raffles, survey education courses and more simply because you can no longer access your old account. </div>
<input class="toggle-box" id="header14" type="checkbox" >
<label for="header14">I have 2 profiles after switching companies.  Do I have 2 raffle tickets?</label>
<div> It may be true that you have created 2 profiles in the past 15 years, but the account that you currently use is the account that you upgrade for Basic Membership and as such will be your winning numbers.  If we draw the number of your previous account and it has not been activated, yet we see that you have upgraded your current account, you are still eligible to win.  As long as one of your accounts is upgraded in good standing, you are eligable to win the prize, if we draw the number associated with your account that you no longer have access to.</div>
<input class="toggle-box" id="header15" type="checkbox" >
<label for="header15">I cannot find my member number.  How often do you update?</label>
<div>We update the member numbers on the 15th of the month and the day before the last day of the month (day before any raffle). If you joined recently, check back on the 16th or after the first as we assign new numbers every two weeks and the day before a raffle. </div>
