# Temple Hamburger Menu Concept

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/JFarrow/pen/rNMqzVW](https://codepen.io/JFarrow/pen/rNMqzVW).

Menu concept using the existing temple logo design of http://mbtkc.org/. Love the idea but fear the usability would be awful... I'd love to see someone fork this and figure out a subtle way to clue the user into the menu button functionality
